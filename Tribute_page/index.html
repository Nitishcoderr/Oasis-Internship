      <h4>Biography</h4>
      <p>
        Steve Jobs is the authorized self-titled biography of American business magnate and Apple
        co-founder Steve Jobs. The book was written at the request of Jobs by Walter Isaacson, a
        former executive at CNN and TIME who had previously written best-selling biographies of
        Benjamin Franklin and Albert Einstein. <br />
        Based on more than forty interviews with Jobs conducted over two years—in addition to
        interviews with more than one hundred family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and
        colleagues—Isaacson was given "unprecedented" access to Jobs's life. Jobs is said to have
        encouraged the people interviewed to speak honestly. Although Jobs cooperated with the book,
        he asked for no control over its content other than the book's cover, and waived the right
        to read it before it was published.Describing his writing, Issacson commented that he had
        striven to take a balanced view of his subject that did not sugarcoat Jobs's flaws. The book
        was released on October 24, 2011, by Simon & Schuster in the United States, 19 days after
        Jobs's death.
